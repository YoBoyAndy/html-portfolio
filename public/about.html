<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello everyone, my name is Andrew Abendroth and it's very nice to meet you all! I am currently an aspiring Accoutning major
  with interests in Finanace, Data Science, Computer Science, and Information Systems.

  I have had 2 internships so far during my college career. I have worked as an audit intern for Baker Tilly of Milwaukee, and I
  am currently apart of the FP&A department of Hoffmaster, a leading manufacturer of disposable utensil and food products.

  This site is a splash page, created entirely by me, to show you all what my interests are, and what I am working on. 
  This site is also meant to be a repository representing what I have done, and where I plan to be in the future. 
  I hope you all enjoy!
